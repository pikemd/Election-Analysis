# VBA-Refactor

## Overview of this project is taking refactor VBA code to sort through the 2017 and 2018 stocks. Using tickers, for loops, and conditional formatting.  

### Purpose of this project to correct the code that did not work. It was also used to a timer to see how quickly the VBA script would work through the data.

## Analysis and Challenges with this was figuring out the best way to change the code, while also keeping some of the orginial code. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered was getting the code to work correctly in order to give the information for the given year you wanted, and the percentage of difference between the starting and ending price.

## Advantages and Disadvantages 

- The advantages of using the orginal code and refractoring it is you have a base line for some of the information needed, but you also have the disadvantage of trying to make sure you keep the data doing what it was intended to be doing verses trying to make it do something else. 

- In this VBA refactoring it has to the advantage of all the tickers were already set up which saved a bit of time to get things started. The disadvantage of working through this code was trying to understand the best way to use data provided to follow the sheet as already set up.
